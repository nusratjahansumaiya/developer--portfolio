                <p>There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first time or returning to
                    a
                    favorite one. People of all ages, from all around the world, go to foreign places for different
                    reasons
                    – mainly, for work, family, and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or by automobile,
                    traveling
                    is
                    generally a pleasurable experience, at least for the people who can financially afford
                    comfortable
                    and
                    safe methods of travel.</p>

                <p>Traveling is a humbling experience. It is merely a superior feeling: to go to another country, and to
                    see
                    people live differently, speak differently, look differently. This is how one comes to understand
                    how
                    big and crazy our world is</p>
